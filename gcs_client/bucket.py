        In conjunction with the prefix filter, the use of the delimiter
        parameter allows the list method to operate like a directory listing,
        despite the object namespace being flat.  For example, if delimiter
        were set to "/", then listing objects from a bucket that contains the
        objects "a/b", "a/c", "d", "e", "e/f" would return objects "d" and "e",
        and prefixes "a/" and "e/".

        The authenticated user must have READER permissions on the bucket.

        Object list operations are eventually consistent. This means that if
        you upload an object to a bucket and then immediately perform a list
        operation on the bucket in which the object is stored, the uploaded
        object might not immediately appear in the returned list of objects.
        However, you can always immediately download a newly-created object
        and get its ACLs because object uploads are strongly consistent.

                           is an encoded field representing the name and
                           generation of the last object in the returned list.
                           In a subsequent request using the pageToken, items
